# 100 NumPy Exercises – With Solutions

This is a personal, fully solved version of the popular **100 NumPy Exercises** collection, originally compiled from the NumPy mailing list, Stack Overflow, and the NumPy documentation. Some additional problems were created by the original author to round out the set to 100.

## What I Did

I have personally solved all 100 exercises in this notebook (`100_Numpy_exercises.ipynb`) as part of my learning journey to strengthen my skills in NumPy and numerical computing in Python. Every solution included is my own work, and I’ve validated the results through experimentation and error handling wherever necessary.

## What's Inside

- 100 NumPy problems of increasing difficulty
- Solutions implemented and explained in Python using NumPy
- Topics covered: arrays, broadcasting, indexing, linear algebra, random number generation, and more

## Developer Notes

The markdown and notebook versions were originally generated programmatically from `source/exercises.ktx` using `generators.py`. However, this repo contains a manually completed and fully executed `.ipynb` notebook (`100_Numpy_exercises.ipynb`) with **all solutions populated**.
